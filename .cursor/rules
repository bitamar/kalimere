# Cursor Guardrails
- lean on repo scripts and migrations; no raw SQL or shell hacks in workflows
- commit Drizzle migrations and meta snapshots together; these are the only schema changes allowed
- backend tests must use `TEST_DATABASE_URL` pointing at a database whose name contains `test`
- if a workaround is unavoidable, capture it as a TODO and fix it before merge
